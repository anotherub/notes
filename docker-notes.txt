docker(refers to the docker client) run(try to create and run a container) image(name of the image to run for the container) this runs the default command also for the image

docker run image command this command is to use our own specific command. This command becomes the default command for that container which means that next time if we use try to use some other command with the container, it wont work

docker ps shows the running container

docker ps --all  lists all the containers ever created

docker run = docker create + docker start

docker create hello-world is used to create the container

docker start -a containerID

-a(attached) : it is used to watch the output from the running container and show on the terminal

docker system prune  is used to delete  

 - all stopped containers
  - all networks not used by at least one container
  - all dangling images
  - all dangling build cache

docker logs containerId to see the logs of the container

docker stop/kill container ID

stop uses SIGTERM/ Helpful for cleanup thing. Should be ideally used

kill used SIGKILL/ Kills the process immediately

if stop doesn't shutdown in 10sec then kill is used

 docker exec -it containerID command

exec is used to run another command

command  is what we want to get executed bydefault

it is used to give input to the container. made of  -i  and -t

i is for input and t is used for nice format

can also use docker run -it busybox sh
*containers are isolated by default. They don't share data by default.

docker build -t name .   for tagging the container with a custom name while creation using a docker file

COPY source destination

 

docker run -p locahost:docker image imagename

docker run image = docker-compose up

docker build . + docker run image= docke-compose up --build   build is used to implement new changes

 docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)  to delete all containers

docker-compose ps / up / down  should be run in the same directory of the docker-compose file

docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -v /app/node_modules -v ${PWD}:/app -e CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true imageID
